## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **Repository Public**: Required for GitHub OIDC integration
- **GitHub Actions**: Free tier sufficient for all planned features
- **Sigstore Infrastructure**: Public Sigstore instance for signing

### Internal Dependencies
- **Current Release**: Must be stable before starting enhancements
- **Documentation Framework**: Diátaxis structure for new docs
- **Testing Infrastructure**: CI/CD pipeline for validation

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Tool Maturity**: Sigstore ecosystem still evolving
  - *Mitigation*: Use stable releases, have fallback plans
- **GitHub Actions Limits**: Free tier resource constraints
  - *Mitigation*: Optimize workflows, consider sponsorship

### Educational Risks
- **Complexity Overload**: Too many security concepts at once
  - *Mitigation*: Progressive disclosure, clear separation of concerns
- **User Experience**: Complex verification processes
  - *Mitigation*: Provide both simple and advanced verification paths

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Additional security features requested
  - *Mitigation*: Clear scope boundaries, separate future enhancements
- **Tool Changes**: Rapid evolution of supply chain tools
  - *Mitigation*: Regular tool evaluation, flexible implementation
