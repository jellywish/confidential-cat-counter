## Major Findings

### ðŸŽ¯ **Critical Under-Discounted Considerations**

#### **1. Modern Web Technologies (HIGH IMPACT)**
- **WebAssembly Integration**: 5-10x performance improvement for client-side cryptography
- **WebCrypto API**: Hardware-accelerated encryption, smaller bundle sizes
- **Web Streams API**: Memory-efficient processing of large files
- **Service Workers**: Offline-first confidential computing capabilities

**Recommendation**: Add WebCrypto API in Phase 2, defer WASM to Phase 3+ for performance-critical deployments

#### **2. Observability Without Compromising Confidentiality (CRITICAL)**
- **OpenTelemetry Integration**: Enterprise-grade monitoring with differential privacy
- **Enclave Performance Monitoring**: Health metrics without exposing sensitive data
- **Property-Based Confidentiality Testing**: Verify no plaintext leakage

**Recommendation**: Add OpenTelemetry in Phase 2 as foundational capability

#### **3. Next-Generation TEE Platforms (STRATEGIC)**
- **Intel TDX**: 3-5% performance overhead vs 10-15% for Nitro Enclaves
- **AMD SEV-SNP**: Full VM confidentiality with better I/O performance
- **ARM CCA**: Positions project for mobile/edge confidential computing

**Recommendation**: Add Intel TDX support in Phase 5-6, ARM CCA in Phase 7+

#### **4. Cost Optimization for TEE Infrastructure (BUSINESS CRITICAL)**
- **Auto-scaling patterns**: Scale to zero when idle
- **Spot instance support**: 70% cost reduction for development
- **Cold start optimization**: Pre-warm model loading

**Recommendation**: Implement in Phase 4 with Terraform infrastructure

#### **5. Developer Experience Gaps (ADOPTION BLOCKER)**
- **Hot reloading in enclaves**: 8-15 minute cycles vs 30-second local development
- **Debugging confidential applications**: Structured debug modes without exposing data
- **Fast development tiers**: Local â†’ Integration â†’ Staging â†’ Production

**Recommendation**: Critical for Phase 1-2 to ensure developer adoption
