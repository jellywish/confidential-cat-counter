```

#### **Enterprise Key Management**
```javascript
// Production keyring with enterprise features
class ProductionKeyringManager {
    static createEnterpriseKeyring(config) {
        return new KmsKeyringBrowser({
            keyIds: config.multiRegionKeys, // Multiple regions
            clientProvider: this.createSecureKmsClient(config),
            grantTokens: config.temporaryGrants, // Time-limited access
            discoveryFilter: config.discoveryFilter, // Restrict key discovery
            // Enterprise encryption context validation
            encryptionContextValidator: this.validateEncryptionContext
        });
    }
    
    static validateEncryptionContext(context) {
        // Validate required fields, data classification, compliance tags
        const required = ['tenant_id', 'data_classification', 'compliance_zone'];
        return required.every(field => context[field]);
    }
}

## Conclusion

This reference architecture demonstrates core confidential computing patterns suitable for learning and prototyping. Production implementations require substantial additional considerations around security, compliance, operations, and business requirements.

**Next Steps for Production Teams:**
1. Conduct threat modeling for your specific use case
2. Define compliance requirements and audit procedures  
3. Design for your specific scale and performance requirements
4. Plan migration strategies from existing systems
5. Establish monitoring and incident response procedures

**Key Principle**: Start simple, measure, and evolve based on real production needs rather than theoretical requirements.
