## Press Release


### Open Source Project Delivers Complete Reference Architecture for Confidential Computing Machine Learning Systems
*First comprehensive implementation combining AWS Nitro Enclaves, client-side encryption, and metadata-based Terms of Use enforcement*

**San Francisco, CA - March 15, 2025** - Today, the open source community gains access to the Confidential Cat Counter Project, a complete reference architecture demonstrating how to build production-ready machine learning systems where user data remains encrypted and opaque to operators throughout the entire processing pipeline. Confidential Cat Counter demonstrates how to harmonize user privacy with terms of use enforcement and provide ML inference entirely within encrypted compute. To get started with the Confidential Cat Counter Project, visit [github.com/spencer/confidential-cat-counter](https://github.com/spencer/confidential-cat-counter).

The exponential growth of privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, state privacy laws) and increasing customer demands for data privacy have created urgent need for ML systems that can process sensitive data without exposing it to operators. Historically, developers had to choose between offering a system that was completely private by using confidential compute, and one that was resistant to abuse and misuse by making all data available to operators. This limitation has prevented confidential computing adoption despite growing regulatory and customer pressure.

The Confidential Cat Counter Project provides the first comprehensive reference architecture that solves these enterprise challenges through innovative patterns. Data is encrypted client-side and decrypted only within the bounds of the enclave, meaning operators can never access the plaintext data, but CCC Project's usage pattern analysis allows operators to use a proprietary model that end customers cannot inspect to ensure that abuse indicators are detected and the customer is unable to abuse the application. Unlike previous academic examples, this project demonstrates a practical development path from local Docker containers to full AWS Nitro Enclave deployment, with each phase delivering testable functionality.

The Confidential Cat Counter Project addresses these gaps by providing production-ready patterns that enterprise teams can immediately adopt and extend. The reference architecture demonstrates that confidential computing can meet both privacy and operational requirements without compromise.

"The Confidential Cat Counter Project transforms confidential computing from academic concept to practical enterprise capability," said Dr. Nyota Uhura, Principal Security Architect at TechCorp. "This is the reference architecture our team has been waiting for to demonstrate privacy-preserving ML at scale."

"Finally, a complete implementation that shows how to enforce policies without sacrificing confidentiality," added Ellen Ripley, VP of Engineering at DataSecure. "The metadata-based TOU enforcement approach will become the industry standard."

The Confidential Cat Counter Project is immediately available as an open source project. Enterprise teams can deploy the complete system in under one hour using the provided Docker Compose configuration. Production deployment to AWS Nitro Enclaves or Azure Confidential Computing requires only AWS CLI setup and a single `make deploy` command.

## External FAQ

### **Q: What exactly is the Confidential Cat Counter Project?**
A: It's a complete reference architecture demonstrating how to build machine learning systems where user data remains encrypted and opaque to operators throughout the entire processing pipeline. While it uses cat detection as a simple, understandable example, the patterns apply to any privacy-sensitive ML use case like healthcare diagnostics, financial fraud detection, or personal data analysis.

### **Q: How is this different from existing confidential computing examples?**
A: Existing examples are typically toy demonstrations that ignore real-world operational challenges. The CCC Project provides:
- Complete TOU enforcement without compromising confidentiality
- Production-ready architecture patterns (message queuing, key management, audit logging)
- Step-by-step development methodology from local Docker to production Nitro Enclaves
- Multi-cloud deployment support (AWS Nitro Enclaves and Azure Confidential Computing)
- Comprehensive testing strategy and documentation

### **Q: What does "Terms of Use enforcement without compromising confidentiality" mean?**
A: Traditional ML systems prevent abuse by monitoring all user content. Confidential computing systems encrypt user data end-to-end, making traditional monitoring impossible. We solve this through metadata-based enforcement - analyzing upload patterns, file characteristics, and usage behavior without ever accessing the encrypted content itself.

### **Q: How long does it take to set up and run?**
A: Less than one hour for the complete local demonstration:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/spencer/confidential-cat-counter
cd confidential-cat-counter
terraform apply -var="deployment=local"  # Starts all services locally
make demo  # Opens browser to demo interface
```

Production deployment to AWS Nitro Enclaves takes 2-3 hours including AWS account setup:
```bash
terraform apply -var="deployment=aws"  # Deploys to AWS Nitro Enclaves
```

### **Q: What technologies does this demonstrate?**
A: The complete stack includes:
- **Client-side encryption**: AWS Encryption SDK for JavaScript
- **Backend services**: Python + FastAPI (ML), Rust (crypto service)
- **Message queuing**: Redis (local) → AWS SQS (production)
- **Key management**: Local keys → AWS KMS with attestation
- **Confidential computing**: Docker → AWS Nitro Enclaves
- **TOU enforcement**: Metadata-based policy enforcement
- **Privacy**: Differential privacy for analytics

### **Q: Can I use this for my own ML models?**
A: Absolutely! The cat detection model is easily replaceable. The reference architecture provides patterns for any ML inference workload. Included documentation shows how to swap in your own ONNX models, adjust input/output formats, and modify the encryption schema.

### **Q: What cloud platforms are supported?**
A: Currently AWS Nitro Enclaves with Azure Confidential Computing support in development. The architecture is designed to be cloud-agnostic with platform-specific adapters for key management and TEE integration.

### **Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: This is a reference architecture designed for learning and adaptation, not a production service. However, all patterns are production-ready and suitable for enterprise adoption. Teams regularly deploy these patterns to handle millions of requests with strict privacy guarantees.

### **Q: How do I get help or support?**
A: Comprehensive documentation includes:
- Architecture deep-dive explaining every component
- Step-by-step tutorial for each development phase  
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Community discussion forum for questions
- Enterprise consulting available for production deployments
