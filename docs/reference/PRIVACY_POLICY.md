# Privacy Policy - Confidential Cat Counter Reference Architecture

**Last Updated**: September 12, 2025  
**Effective Date**: September 12, 2025

## Overview

The Confidential Cat Counter is a **reference architecture and educational demonstration** of privacy-preserving machine learning techniques. This privacy policy explains how data is handled in this open-source software.

## Important Notice: Local-Only Operation

**üîí This application operates entirely on your local system. No data is transmitted to external servers.**

- ‚úÖ All processing happens on your local machine
- ‚úÖ No data leaves your computer
- ‚úÖ No external API calls for ML inference
- ‚úÖ No user tracking or analytics
- ‚úÖ No cookies or persistent identifiers

## Data Processing

### What Data Is Processed
- **Images**: Photos you upload for cat detection
- **Processing Metadata**: File size, type, upload timestamp
- **ML Results**: Detection results (cat count, confidence scores)

### How Data Is Processed
1. **Client-Side Encryption**: Images can be encrypted in your browser before processing
2. **Local ML Inference**: Machine learning runs entirely on your local Docker containers
3. **Temporary Storage**: Uploaded files are stored temporarily in local Docker volumes
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: Files are automatically deleted based on retention policies

### Data Retention
- **Uploaded Images**: Stored temporarily in `./data/uploads/` directory
- **Processing Results**: Stored temporarily in `./data/results/` directory  
- **Default Retention**: 24 hours (configurable)
- **Manual Cleanup**: Available via `scripts/cleanup.sh`

## Technical Privacy Features

### Encryption
- **Client-Side Encryption**: AWS Encryption SDK implementation for browser
- **Encryption Context**: Metadata-only (no PII)
- **Key Management**: Local raw AES keys (not cloud-based)

### Data Minimization
- **No PII Collection**: No personally identifiable information required
- **Filename Anonymization**: Original filenames are not stored in logs
- **Metadata Only**: Only technical metadata is logged

### Security Measures
- **Magic-Byte Validation**: Only image files accepted
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse (100 uploads per 15 minutes)
- **Input Sanitization**: All uploads validated before processing
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive data in error messages

## No External Data Sharing

This application **DOES NOT**:
- ‚ùå Send data to external APIs
- ‚ùå Connect to cloud ML services
- ‚ùå Upload files to remote servers
- ‚ùå Share data with third parties
- ‚ùå Use tracking pixels or analytics
- ‚ùå Store data in external databases

## Developer and Deployment Responsibilities

### For Developers Using This Code
If you modify or deploy this reference architecture:

1. **Review Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies maintain privacy standards
2. **Local-Only Promise**: Maintain the local-only operational model
3. **Encryption Standards**: Follow established encryption patterns
4. **Data Minimization**: Continue PII-free design principles

### For Production Deployments
If adapting this reference for production use:

1. **Privacy Impact Assessment**: Conduct thorough privacy review
2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure compliance with GDPR, CCPA, etc.
3. **Security Audit**: Professional security review recommended
4. **User Consent**: Implement appropriate consent mechanisms
5. **Data Governance**: Establish data retention and deletion policies

## Technical Logging

### What Is Logged
- **Application Events**: Startup, processing, errors
- **Performance Metrics**: Processing times, file sizes
- **Security Events**: Rate limiting, validation failures

### What Is NOT Logged
- ‚ùå Original filenames
- ‚ùå File contents or image data
- ‚ùå Personal information
- ‚ùå IP addresses (in reference implementation)
- ‚ùå User identifiers

## Your Rights and Control

### Data Control
- **Full Control**: You maintain complete control over your data
- **Local Access**: All data remains on your local system
- **Easy Deletion**: Simple cleanup scripts provided
- **No Account Required**: No registration or authentication needed

### Transparency
- **Open Source**: All code is publicly available for review
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive technical documentation provided
- **Audit Trail**: Processing logs available for review

## Educational and Research Use

This software is designed for:
- ‚úÖ Educational demonstrations
- ‚úÖ Privacy research
- ‚úÖ Architecture reference
- ‚úÖ Development learning

It is **NOT intended** for:
- ‚ùå Production data processing without modification
- ‚ùå Processing sensitive or personal data without review
- ‚ùå Commercial use without proper privacy assessment

## Contact and Support

### For Privacy Questions
- **GitHub Issues**: [Repository Issues Page]
- **Documentation**: See `docs/` directory for technical details
- **Community**: Open-source community support only

### For Legal or Compliance Questions
This is open-source educational software. For legal or compliance questions related to your specific use case, consult with appropriate legal counsel.

## Changes to This Policy

This privacy policy may be updated as the reference architecture evolves. Changes will be:
- Documented in version control
- Announced in release notes
- Maintained in this document

## Compliance Framework

This reference architecture is designed with privacy principles:
- **Privacy by Design**: Built-in privacy protections
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data
- **Purpose Limitation**: Data used only for stated purposes
- **Storage Limitation**: Automatic data cleanup
- **Transparency**: Open documentation and code

## Summary

**The Confidential Cat Counter prioritizes your privacy through:**
- üîí **Local-only operation** - no external data transmission
- üõ°Ô∏è **Client-side encryption** - data protection in your browser
- üßπ **Automatic cleanup** - no permanent data retention
- üìñ **Open source** - complete transparency and auditability
- üéì **Educational focus** - designed for learning, not production data processing

**Your data never leaves your computer.**
